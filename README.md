# Arch Linux Post Installation Setup Script

dlemonbox installs the Pacman wrapper and AUR helper yay, updates the system, and sets up a basic desktop environment including openbox, dmenu and lemonbar.

[setup.sh](setup.sh) describes the installation procedure and the software included.

The system uses less than 300Mb RAM. All main DE features can be controlled with the key bindings (Ctrl+k lists the key bindings) and from the statusbar and taskbar with left and/or right clicks on the icons.

Mounted external devices (including HDMI) are shown and can be accessed from the statusbar.

The [configuration files](filesystem/home/user/) located in ~ and downstream control the entire DE.
